# Beginner Bootcamp Homework

Hello beginner bootcampers. Here is your first formal homework  assignment!


**I expect you to do this assignment individually. I will notice if you copy another students code.**  
To be 100% clear: If I notice you copying other students homework you will get an invoice for the course.  
Don't discuss the homework in slack

- Download the starter files
- Make a local git repo and use it to track your work
- When you're done add a remote and push to your github
- The link to your repo should look something like: git@github.com:YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME.git
- **Send the link to your repo to teachers@codaisseur.com before Saturday 22:00**

Expectations:
- I expect you give this homework assignment your best shot.
- You should be able to complete this homework without my help if there was no time limit.
- I expect you to spend 6-8 hours on this assignment. You can spend more but prioritize enough sleep, doing laundry etc.
- I expect people without experience to be able to implement most tests
- I expect some people with programming experience before this bootcamp to able to finish the whole assignment within the time-limit.

Tips:
- Use readest, stackoverflow and documentation, w3schools had easy to understand examples.
- Check the tests on the page for hints
- Write the code step by step and use console.log() to check yourself  
- If you can't get a certain test to pass try a different one. **Don't get stuck on a single thing for a whole day.**  
- You get no points for Extra CSS that is not in the assignment (except the fuzzy feeling in your own brain)
- If you feel you had a bad result write a reflection on your way of working in the readme of your project.

## What are we building?

We are building (the start) of a game

Minimal game:

- You play as a hero and you have some "stats" like health and inventory
- By clicking different pictures the stats of the hero get changed

Additional features:

- A player can choose their own name
- We want to display the stats to the player so she knows what happened
- When some stats change we want to show the updated stats
- Make it possible to fight enemies

## Section 1. Creating the hero object

**Press the 'Run the tests' button to run the automated tests** 
Follow the instructions in section to create the hero object.

## Section 2. Implementing the basic game logic and UI

**Press the 'Run the tests' button to run the automated tests**
Follow the instructions to implment `resting`, `picking up items` and `equipping a weapon` game logic. These are all functions that will manipulate your hero object. Each of these function will need some user interface.

**note:** You could implement this game logic in *many* other ways. But in order for the tests to guide you the instructions are very specific.

## Section 3. CSS

- Link an external stylesheet and make all the pictures the same size.

## Section 4 - Show me what you got

- Allow people to change the name of their hero, you can use window.prompt or use an input element. Be careful using a form because using a form might refresh the page.

- Write `displayStats` function that writes your hero's name, health, weapontype, weapon damage to the page. Call it at the end of your script

- Call `displayStats` when some data of the hero has changed to update the page.

- Implement fighting an enemy. (how you do it is up to you!)

- When an enemy or weapon gets clicked it gets deleted from the page

Student notes;

Hi There,

This is Alexander Rowntree's Codaisseur homework project. 

The game is called "History relived with Alexander the Great." 

In this game it is the player's goal to gather as many weapons and rest as much as possible. In the future, enemies will be created and you will have to fight to protect your empire.

As stated above, this is my first assignment after an intensive week of learning at the Codaisseur academy. Reflecting back on this week and the assignment, I feel that I already been able to absorb a substantial amount of new information. Concepts are becoming clear for me. The best analogy that I can come up with to discribe my experience would be how I would think being blasted by a fire hose would feel. Only with information instead of water. 

Creating an object and defining it's propertes & values section was done with confidence functions became a little more challanging but were doable too after some additional research. Manipulating my HTML with DOM commands was the section that I spent the most time on and the section that I will review a little deeper tomorrow during my day off. I am confident that this concept will become clear over time. 
 
 Time spent in total on this assignment is 7 hours and 45 minutes.
