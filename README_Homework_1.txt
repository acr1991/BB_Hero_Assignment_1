Hi There,

This is Alexander Rowntree's Codaisseur homework project. 

The game is called "History relived with Alexander the Great." 

In this game it is the player's goal to gather as many weapons and rest as much as possible. In the future, enemies will be created and you will have to fight to protect your empire.

As stated above, this is my first assignment after an intensive week of learning at the Codaisseur academy. Reflecting back on this week and the assignment, I feel that I already been able to absorb a substantial amount of new information. Concepts are becoming clear for me. The best analogy that I can come up with to discribe my experience would be how I would think being blasted by a fire hose would feel. Only with information instead of water. 

Creating an object and defining it's propertes & values section was done with confidence functions became a little more challanging but were doable too after some additional research. Manipulating my HTML with DOM commands was the section that I spent the most time on and the section that I will review a little deeper tomorrow during my day off. I am confident that this concept will become clear over time. 
 
 Time spent in total on this assignment is 7 hours and 45 minutes.
